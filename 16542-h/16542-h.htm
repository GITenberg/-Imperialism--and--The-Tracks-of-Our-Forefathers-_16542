<p>What the feast of the Passover was to the children of
Israel, that the days between the nineteenth of December
and the fourth of January&mdash;the Yuletide&mdash;are and will
remain to the people of New England. The Passover began
"in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at
even," and it lasted one week, "until the one and twentieth
day of the month at even." It was the period of the sacrifice
of the Paschal lamb, and the feast of unleavened bread; and
of it as a commemoration it is written, "When your children
shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? that
ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who
passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
when he smote the Egyptians. Now the sojourning of the
children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred
and thirty years." And thus, by their yearly Passover,
were the Jewish congregations of old put in mind what
farewell they took of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>So our own earliest records tell us that it was on the
morning of Saturday, of what is now the nineteenth of
December, that the little exploring party from the <i>Mayflower</i>,
then lying at her anchor in Provincetown Harbor, after a
day and night of much trouble and danger, sorely buffeted
by wind and wave in rough New England's December seas,
found themselves on an island in Plymouth Bay. It was a
mild, "faire sunshining day. And this being the last day of
the weeke, they prepared ther to keepe the Sabath. On
Munday they sounded the harbor, and marched into the land,
and found a place fitt for situation. So they returned to
their shipp againe [at Provincetown] with this news. On
the twenty-fifth of December they weyed anchor to goe to
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>the place they had discovered, and came within two leagues
of it, but were faine to bear up againe; but the twenty-sixth
day, the winde came faire, and they arrived safe in this
harbor. And after wards tooke better view of the place, and
resolved wher to pitch their dwelling; and the fourth day [of
January] begane to erecte the first house for commone use to
receive them and their goods." Such, in the quaint language
of Bradford, is the calendar of New England's Passover;
and, beginning on the nineteenth of December, it ends on
the fourth of January, covering as nearly as may be the
Christmas holyday period.</p>

<p>Is there any better use to which the Passover anniversary
can be put than to retrospection? "And when your children
shall say unto you, What mean you by this service?
ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, when
he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses." So the
old story is told again, being thus kept ever green in memory;
and, in telling it, the experiences of the past are brought
insensibly to bear on the conditions of the present. Thus,
once a year, like the Israelites of old, we, as a people, may
take our bearings and verify our course, as we plunge on out
of the infinite past into the unknowable future. It is a
useful practice; and we are here this first evening of our
Passover period to observe it.</p>

<p>This, too, is an Historical Society,&mdash;that of Lexington, "a
name," as, when arraigned before the tribunal of the French
Terror, Danton said of his own, "tolerably known in the
Revolution;" and I am invited to address you because I am
President of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the most
venerable organization of the sort in America, perhaps in the
world. Thus, to-night, though we shall necessarily have to
touch on topics of the day, and topics exciting the liveliest
interest and most active discussion, we will in so doing look
at them,&mdash;not as politicians or as partisans, nor from the
commercial or religious side, but solely from the historical
point of view. We shall judge of the present in its relations
to the past. And, unquestionably, there is great satisfaction
to be derived from so doing; the mere effort seems at once to
take us into another atmosphere,&mdash;an atmosphere as foreign
to unctuous cant as it is to what is vulgarly known as
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>"electioneering taffy." This evening we pass away from
the noisy and heated turmoil of partisan politics, with its
appeals to prejudice, passion, and material interest, into the
cool of a quiet academic discussion. It is like going out of
some turbulent caucus, or exciting ward-room debate, and
finding oneself suddenly confronted by the cold, clear light
of the December moon, shining amid the silence of innumerable
stars.</p>

<p>Addressing ourselves, therefore, to the subject in hand, the
question at once suggests itself,&mdash;What year in recent times
has been in a large way more noteworthy and impressive,
when looked at from the purely historical point of view, than
this year of which we are now observing the close? The
first Passover of the Israelites ended a drama of more than
four centuries' duration, for "the sojourning of the children
of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and
thirty years; and at the end of the four hundred and thirty
years all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land
of Egypt." So the Passover we now celebrate commemorates
the closing of another world drama of almost precisely
the same length, and one of deepest significance, as
well as unsurpassed historic interest. These world dramas
are lengthy affairs; for, while we men are always in a hurry,
the Almighty never is: on the contrary, as the Psalmist
observed, so now, "a thousand years in his sight are but as
yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night."
The drama I have referred to as this week brought to its
close, is that known in history as Spanish Domination in
America. It began, as we all know, on the twenty-first of
October, 1492; it has been continuous through six years over
four centuries. It now passes into history; the verdict may
be made up.</p>

<p>So far as I personally am concerned,&mdash;a matter needless
to say of very trifling consequence,&mdash;this verdict was rendered
a year ago. It was somewhat Rhadamanthine; but a
twelve-month of further reflection has shown no cause in any
respect to revise it. In referring to what was then plainly
impending, in December, 1897, before the blowing up of the
battleship <i>Maine</i>, before a conflict had become inevitable, I
used this language in a paper read to the Massachusetts Historical
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>Society: "When looking at the vicissitudes of human
development, we are apt to assume a certain air of optimism,
and take advancement as the law of being, as a thing of course,
indisputable. We are charitable, too; and to deny to any
given race or people some degree of use in the economy of
Nature, or the plan of Creation, is usually regarded as indicative
of narrowness of view. The fatal, final word "pessimist"
is apt to be whispered in connection with the name of
one who ventures to suggest a doubt of this phase of the
doctrine known as Universalism. And yet, at this time
when, before our eyes, it is breathing its last, I want some
one to point out a single good thing in law, or science, or art,
or literature,&mdash;material, moral or intellectual,&mdash;which has
resulted to the race of man upon earth from Spanish domination
in America. I have tried to think of one in vain. It
certainly has not yielded an immortality, an idea, or a discovery;
it has, in fact, been one long record of reaction and
retrogression, than which few pages in the record of mankind
have been more discouraging or less fruitful of good. What
is now taking place in Cuba is historical. It is the dying
out of a dominion, the influence of which will be seen and felt
for centuries in the life of two continents; just as what is
taking place in Turkey is the last fierce flickering up of
Asiatic rule in Europe, on the very spot where twenty-four
centuries ago Asiatic rule in Europe was thought to have
been averted forever. The two, Ottoman rule in Europe, and
Spanish rule in America, now stand at the bar of history;
and, scanning the long four-century record of each, I have
been unable to see what either has contributed to the accumulated
possessions of the human race, or why both should not
be classed among the many instances of the arrested civilization
of a race, developing by degrees an irresistible tendency
to retrogression."</p>

<p>This, one year ago; and while the embers of the last Greco-Turkish
struggle, still white, were scarcely cold on the plain
of Marathon. The time since passed has yielded fresh proof
in support of this harsh judgment; for, if there is one historical
law better and more irreversibly established than another,
it is that, in the case of nations even more than in the case
of individuals, their sins will find them out,&mdash;the day of
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>reckoning may not be escaped. Noticeably, has this proved
so in the case of Spain. The year 1500 may be said to have
found that country at the apex of her greatness. America
had then been newly discovered; the Moor was just subdued.
Nearly half a century before (1453) the Roman Empire had
fallen, and, with the storming of Constantinople by the Saracens,
disappeared from the earth. That event, it may be
mentioned in passing, closed another world drama continuous
through twenty-two centuries,&mdash;upon the whole the most
wonderful of the series. And so, when Roman empire
vanished, that of Spain began. It was ushered in by the
landfall of Columbus; and when, just three hundred years
later, in 1792, the subject was discussed in connection
with its third centennial, the general verdict of European
thinkers was that the discovery of America had, upon the
whole, been to mankind the reverse of beneficent. This
conclusion has since been commented upon with derision;
yet, when made, it was right. The United States had in
1792 just struggled into existence, and its influence on the
course of human events had not begun to make itself felt.
Those who considered the subject had before them, therefore,
only Spanish domination in America, and upon that their
verdict cannot be gainsaid; for, from the year 1492 down,
the history of Spain and Spanish domination has undeniably
been one long series of crimes and violations of natural law,
the penalty for which has not apparently even yet been
exacted in full.</p>

<p>Of those national crimes four stand out in special prominence,
constituting counts in a national indictment than
which history shows few more formidable. These four were:
(1) The expulsion, first, of the Jews, and then of the Moors,
or Moriscoes, from Spain, late in the fifteenth and early in
the sixteenth centuries; (2) the annals of "the Council of
Blood" in the Netherlands, and the eighty years of internecine
warfare through which Holland fought its way out
from under Spanish rule; (3) the Inquisition, the most ingenious
human machinery ever invented to root out and
destroy whatever a people had that was intellectually most
alert, inquisitive, and progressive; and, finally (4), the policy
of extermination, and, where not of extermination, of cruel
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>oppression, systematically pursued towards the aborigines of
America. Into the grounds on which the different counts
of this indictment rest it would be impossible now to enter.
Were it desirable so to do, time would not permit. Suffice it
to say, the penalty had to be paid to the uttermost farthing;
and one large instalment fell due, and was mercilessly exacted,
during the year now drawing to its close. Spanish domination
in America ceased,&mdash;the drama ended as it was entering
on its fifth century,&mdash;and it can best be dismissed with the
solemn words of Abraham Lincoln, uttered more than thirty
years ago, when contemplating a similar expiation we were
ourselves paying in blood and grief for a not dissimilar violation
of an everlasting law,&mdash;"Yet, if God wills that this
mighty scourge continue until all the wealth piled by the
bondsmen's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil
shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the
lash shall be paid by another drawn by the sword, as was said
three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, 'The
judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether!'"</p>

<p>But not only is this year memorable as witnessing the
downfall and complete extirpation of that Spanish rule in
America which began with Columbus, but the result, when it
at last came about, was marked by incidents more curiously
fitting and dramatic than it would have been possible for a
Shakspeare to have conceived. Columbus, as we all know,
stumbled, as it were, on America as he sailed west in search
of Asia,&mdash;Cipango he was looking for, and he found Cuba.
It is equally well known that he never discovered his mistake.
When fourteen years later he died, it was in the faith that,
through him, Europe had by a westward movement established
itself in the archipelagoes of Asia. And now, at last,
four centuries afterward, the blow which did most to end the
American domination he established was struck in Asiatic
waters; and, through it and the descendants of another race,
America seems on the threshold of realizing the mistaken
belief of Columbus, and by a westward movement establishing
the European in that very archipelago Columbus failed to
reach. The ways of Providence are certainly not less singular
than slow in movement.</p>

<p>But the year just ending was veritably one of surprises,&mdash;for
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>the historical student it would, indeed, seem as if 1898
was destined to pass into the long record as almost the Year
of Surprises. We now come to the consideration of some of
these wholly unanticipated results from the American point
of view. And in entering on this aspect of the question, it is
necessary once more to remind you that we are doing it in the
historical spirit, and from the historical point of view. We
are stating facts not supposed to admit of denial. The argument
and inferences to be drawn from those facts do not belong
to this occasion. Some will reach one conclusion as to the
future, and the bearing those facts have upon its probable
development, and some will reach another conclusion; with
these conclusions we have nothing to do. Our business is
exclusively with the facts.</p>

<p>Speaking largely, but still with all necessary historical
accuracy, America has been peopled, and its development,
up to the present time, worked out through two great stocks
of the European family,&mdash;the Spanish-speaking stock, and
the English-speaking stock. In their development these two
have pursued lines, clearly marked, but curiously divergent.
Leaving the Spanish-speaking branch out of the discussion, as
unnecessary to it, it may without exaggeration be said of the
English-speaking branch that, from the beginning down to
this year now ending, its development has been one long protest
against, and divergence from, Old World methods and
ideals. In the case of those descended from the Forefathers,&mdash;as
we always designate the Plymouth colony,&mdash;this has
been most distinctly marked, ethnically, politically, industrially.</p>

<p>America was the sphere where the European, as a colonist,
a settler, first came on a large scale in contact with another
race. Heretofore, in the Old World, when one stock had
overrun another,&mdash;and history presented many examples of
it,&mdash;the invading stock, after subduing, and to a great
extent driving out, the stock which had preceded in the occupancy
of a region, settled gradually down into a common possession,
and, in the slow process of years, an amalgamation
of stocks, more or less complete, took place. In America,
with the Anglo-Saxon, and especially those of the New England
type, this was not the case. Unlike the Frenchman at
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>the north, or the Spaniard at the south, the Anglo-Saxon
showed no disposition to ally himself with the aborigines,&mdash;he
evinced no faculty of dealing with inferior races, as they
are called, except through a process of extermination.
Here in Massachusetts this was so from the outset. Nearly
every one here has read Longfellow's poem, "The Courtship
of Miles Standish," and calls to mind the short, sharp
conflict between the Plymouth captain and the Indian chief,
Pecksuot, and how those God-fearing Pilgrims ruthlessly put
to death by stabbing and hanging a sufficient number of the
already plague-stricken and dying aborigines. That episode
occurred in April, 1623, only a little more than two years
after the landing we to-night celebrate, and was, so far as
New England is concerned, the beginning of a series of
wars which did not end until the Indian ceased to be an element
in our civilization. When John Robinson, the revered
pastor of the Plymouth church, received tidings at Leyden of
that killing near Plymouth,&mdash;for Robinson never got across
the Atlantic,&mdash;he wrote: "Oh, how happy a thing had it
been, if you had converted some before you had killed any!
There is cause to fear that, by occasion, especially of provocation,
there may be wanting that tenderness of the life of
man (made after God's image) which is meet. It is also a
thing more glorious in men's eyes, than pleasing in God's or
convenient for Christians, to be a terror to poor, barbarous
people." This all has a very familiar sound. It is the refrain of
nearly three centuries; but, as an historical fact, it is undeniable
that, from 1623 down to the year now ending, the American
Anglo-Saxon has in his dealings with what are known
as the "inferior races" lacked "that tenderness of the life
of man which is meet," and he has made himself "a terror to
poor, barbarous people." How we of Massachusetts carried
ourselves towards the aborigines here, the fearful record of
the Pequot war remains everlastingly to tell. How the
country at large has carried itself in turn towards Indian,
African, and Asiatic is matter of history. And yet it is
equally matter of history that this carriage, term it what
you will,&mdash;unchristian, brutal, exterminating,&mdash;has been
the salvation of the race. It has saved the Anglo-Saxon
stock from being a nation of half-breeds,&mdash;miscegenates, to
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>coin a word expressive of an idea. The Canadian half-breed,
the Mexican, the mulatto, say what men may, are not virile
or enduring races; and that the Anglo-Saxon is none of these,
and is essentially virile and enduring, is due to the fact that
the less developed races perished before him. Nature is undeniably
often brutal in its methods.</p>

<p>Again, and on the other hand, the Anglo-Saxon when he
came to America left behind him, so far as he himself was
concerned, feudalism and all things pertaining to caste, including
what was then known in England, and is still known
in Germany, as Divine Right. When he at last enunciated
his political faith he put in the forefront of his declaration as
"self-evident truths," the principles "that all men are created
equal;" that they are endowed with "certain inalienable
rights," among them "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;"
and that governments derived "their just powers from
the consent of the governed." Now what was meant here by
the phrase "all men are created equal?" We know they
are not. They are not created equal in physical or mental
endowment; nor are they created with equal opportunity.
The world bristles with inequalities, natural and artificial.
This is so; and yet the declaration is none the less true;&mdash;true
when made; true now; true for all future time. The
reference was to the inequalities which always had marked,
then did, and still do, mark, the political life of the Old World,&mdash;to
Caste, Divine Right, Privilege. It declared that all men
were created equal before the law, as before the Lord;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>that, whether European, American, Asiatic, or African, they
were endowed with an inalienable right to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness. And to this truth, as he saw it,
Lincoln referred in those memorable words I have already
cited bearing on our national crime in long forgetfulness of
our own immutable principles. The fundamental, primal
principle was indeed more clearly voiced by Lincoln than it
has been voiced before, or since, in declaring again, and elsewhere
that to our nation, dedicated "to the proposition that
all men are created equal," has by Providence been assigned
the momentous task of "testing whether any nation so conceived
and so dedicated can long endure," and "that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth."</p>

<p>The next cardinal principle in our policy as a race&mdash;that
instinctive policy I have already referred to as divergent from
Old World methods and ideals&mdash;was most dearly enunciated
by Washington in his Farewell Address, that "the great rule
for us in regard to foreign nations is, in extending our commercial
relations, to have with them as little political connection
as possible;" that it was "unwise in us to implicate
ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of [Old
World] policies, or the ordinary combinations and collisions
of her friendships or enmities. Our detached and distant situation
invites and enables us to pursue a different course....
Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments
on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust
to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies."</p>

<p>Accepting this as firm ground from which to act, we afterwards
put forth what is known as the Monroe Doctrine. Having
announced that our purpose was, in homely language, to
mind our own business, we warned the outer world that we
did not propose to permit by that outer world any interference
in what did not concern it. America was our field,&mdash;a field
amply large for our development. It was therefore declared
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>that, while we had never taken any part, nor did it comport
with our policy to do so, in the wars of European politics,
with the movements in this hemisphere we are, of necessity,
more intimately connected. "We owe it, therefore, to candor
to declare that we should consider any attempt [on the part
of European powers] to extend their system to any portion of
this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."</p>

<p>On these principles of government and of foreign policy we
have as a people now acted for more than seventy years.
They have been exemplified and developed in various directions,
and resulted in details&mdash;commercial, economic, and
ethnic&mdash;which have given rise to political issues, long and
hotly contested, but which, in their result from the purely
historical point of view, do not admit of dispute. Commercially,
we have adopted what is known as a system protective
both of our industries and our labor. Economically, we
have carefully eschewed large and costly armaments, and
expensive governmental methods. Ethnically, we have
avowed our desire to have as little contact as possible with
less developed races, lamenting the presence of the African,
and severely excluding the Asiatic. These facts, whether we
as individuals and citizens wholly approve&mdash;or do not approve
at all&mdash;of the course pursued and the results reached,
admit of no dispute. Neither can it be denied that our attitude,
whether it in all respects commanded the respect of
foreign nations, or failed to command it, was accepted, and
has prevailed. Striking illustrations of this at once suggest
themselves.</p>

<p>In one respect especially was our attitude peculiar, and in
its peculiarity we took great pride. It was largely moral;
but, though largely moral, it had behind it the consciousness
of strength in ourselves, and its recognition by others. In
great degree, and relatively, an unarmed people, we looked
with amaze, which had in it something of amusement, at the
constantly growing armaments and war budgets of the nations
of Europe. We saw them, like the warriors of the middle ages,
crushed under the weight of their weapons of offence, and their
preparations for defence. Meanwhile, fortunate in our geographical
position,&mdash;weak for offence, but, in turn, unassailable,&mdash;we
went in and out much as an unarmed man,
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>relying on his character, his recognized force, position, and
peaceful calling, daily moves about in our frontier settlements
and mining camps amid throngs of men armed to
the teeth with revolvers and bowie knives. Yet, evidence
was not lacking of the consideration yielded to us when we
were called upon, or felt called upon, to assert ourselves. I
will not refer to the episode of 1866, when, in accordance
with the principles of the Monroe Doctrine, we intimated to
France that her immediate withdrawal from Mexico was
desired; for then we had not laid down the arms we had
taken up in the Rebellion. But, without remonstrance even,
France withdrew. In 1891, under circumstances not without
grounds of aggravation against us, a mob in Valparaiso
assaulted some seamen from our ships of war. Instant
apology and redress were demanded; and the demand was
complied with. Yet later, the course pursued by us in the
Venezuela matter is too fresh in memory to call for more than
a reference. These are all matters of history. When did our
word fail to carry all desired weight?</p>

<p>Such were our standing, our traditional policy, and our
record at the beginning of the year now ending. No proposition
advanced admits, it is believed, of dispute historically.
Into the events of the year 1898 it is not necessary to enter
in any detail. They are in the minds of all. It is sufficient
to say that the primary object for which we entered upon the
late war with Spain was to bring to an end the long and
altogether bad record of Spanish rule in America. In taking
the steps deemed necessary to effect this result, Congress
went out of its way, and publicly and formally put upon
record its disclaimer of any intention to enter upon a war of
conquest, asserting its determination, when Spanish domination
was ended, to leave the government of Cuba, and
presumably of any other islands similarly acquired, to the
people thereof. As an incident to our naval operations on
the Pacific, the island of Hawaii was then annexed to the
United States as an extra-territorial possession, or coaling
station, this being effected by a joint resolution of the two
Houses of Congress, under the precedent of 1845 established
in the case of Texas,&mdash;a method of procedure the constitutionality
of which was at the time formally called in question
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>by the State of Massachusetts, and against which Mr. Webster
made vigorous protest in the Senate. In thus possessing
ourselves of Hawaii, the consent of the native inhabitants was
not considered necessary; we dealt wholly with an oligarchical
<i>de facto</i> government, representing the foreign element,
mainly American, there resident.</p>

<p>Shortly after the acquisition of Hawaii, we, as the result
of brilliant naval operations and successes, acquired possession
of the harbor of Manila, in the Philippine archipelago,
and finally the city and some adjacent territory were surrendered
to us. A treaty was then negotiated, the power of
Spain being completely broken, under which she abandoned
all claims of sovereignty, not only over the island of Cuba,
the original cause of war, but over various other islands in
the Philippine, as well as in the West Indian, archipelagoes.
These islands, in all said to be some 1,200 to 1,500 in number,
are moreover not only inhabited by both natives and foreigners
to the estimated number of ten to twelve million of
souls, but they contain large cities and communities speaking
different tongues, living under other laws, and having customs,
manners, and traditions wholly unlike our own, and
which, in the case of the Philippines, do not admit of assimilation.
Situated in the tropics also, they cannot gradually
become colonized by Americans, with or without the disappearance
of the native population. The American can only
go there for temporary residence.</p>

<p>A wholly new problem was thus suddenly presented to the
people of the United States. On the one hand, it is asserted
that, by destroying Spanish government in these islands, the
United States has assumed responsibility for them, both to
the inhabitants and to the world. This is a moral obligation.
On the other hand, trade and commercial inducements are
held out which would lead us to treat these islands simply as
a commencement&mdash;the first instalment&mdash;in a system of unlimited
extra-territorial dependencies and imperial expansion.
With these responsibilities and obligations we here this evening
have nothing to do, any more than we have to do with
the expediency or probable results of the policy of colonial
expansion, when once fairly adopted and finally entered upon.
These hereafter will be, but are not yet, historical questions;
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>and we are merely historical inquirers. We, therefore, no
matter what others may do, must try to confine ourselves to
our own proper business and functions.</p>

<p>My purpose, therefore, is not to argue for or against what
is now proposed, but simply to test historically some of the
arguments I have heard most commonly advanced in favor
of the proposed policy of expansion, and thus see to what
they apparently lead in the sequence of human, and more
especially of American, events. Do they indicate an historic
continuity? Or do they result in what is geologically
known as a "fault,"&mdash;a movement, as the result of force,
through which a stratum, once continuous, becomes disconnected?</p>

<p>In the first place, then, as respects the inhabitants of the
vastly greater number of the dependencies already acquired,
and, under the policy of imperialistic expansion, hereafter to
be acquired. It is argued that we, as a people at once
dominant and Christian, are under an obligation to avail
ourselves of the opportunity the Almighty, in his infinite
wisdom, has thrust upon us,&mdash;some say the plain call he
has uttered to us,&mdash;to go forth, and impart to the barbarian
and the heathen the blessings of liberty and the Bible. A
mission is imposed upon us. Viewed in the cold, pitiless
light of history,&mdash;and that is the only way we here can view
them,&mdash;"divine missions" and "providential calls" are
questionable things; things the assumption and fulfilment
of which are apt to be at variance. So far as the American
is concerned, as I have already pointed out, the historic
precedents are not encouraging. Whatever his theories,
ethnical, political, or religious, his practice has been as
pronounced as it was masterful. From the earliest days at
Wessagusset and in the Pequot war, down to the very last
election held in North Carolina,&mdash;from 1623 to 1898,&mdash;the
knife and the shotgun have been far more potent and active
instruments in his dealings with the inferior races than the
code of liberty or the output of the Bible Society. The
record speaks for itself. So far as the Indian is concerned,
the story has been told by Mrs. Jackson in her earnest,
eloquent protest, entitled "A Century of Dishonor." It has
received epigrammatic treatment in the saying tersely enunciated
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>by one of our military commanders, and avowedly
accepted by the others, that "the only good Indian is a
dead Indian." So far as the African is concerned, the
similar apothegm once was that "the black man has no
rights the white man is bound to respect;" or, as Stephen
A. Douglas defined his position before an applauding audience,
"I am for the white man as against the black man,
and for the black man against the alligator." Recent lynching
and shotgun experiences, too fresh in memory to call for
reminder, and too painful in detail to describe, give us at
least reason to pause before we leave our own hearthstone
to seek new and distant fields for missionary labors. It
remains to consider the Asiatic. The racial antipathy of the
American towards him has been more intense than towards
any other species of the human race. This, as an historical
fact, has been recently imbedded in our statute-book, having
previously been illustrated in a series of outrages and massacres,
with the sickening details of some of which it was at
one time my misfortune to be officially familiar. Under these
circumstances, so far as the circulation of the Bible and the
extension of the blessings of liberty are concerned, history
affords small encouragement to the American to assume new
obligations. He has been, and now is, more than merely
delinquent in the fulfilment of obligations heretofore thrust
upon him, or knowingly assumed. In this respect his instinct
has proved much more of a controlling factor than his ethics,&mdash;the
shotgun has unfortunately been more constantly in
evidence than the Bible. As a prominent "expansionist"
New England member of the present Congress has recently
declared in language, brutal perhaps in directness, but
withal commendably free from cant: "China is succumbing
to the inevitable, and the United States, if she would not
retire to the background, must advance along the line with
the other great nations. She must acquire new territory,
providing new markets over which she must maintain control.
The Anglo-Saxon advances into the new regions with a Bible
in one hand and a shotgun in the other. The inhabitants of
those regions that he cannot convert with the aid of the
Bible and bring into his markets, he gets rid of with the
shotgun. It is but another demonstration of the survival of
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>the fittest." (Hon. C.A. Sulloway, Rochester, N.H.,
Nov. 22, 1898.)</p>

<p>Next as regards our fundamental principles of equality of
human rights, and the consent of the governed as the only
just basis of all government. The presence of the inferior
races on our own soil, and our new problems connected with
them in our dependencies, have led to much questioning of
the correctness of those principles, which, for its outspoken
frankness, at least, is greatly to be commended. It is argued
that these, as principles, in the light of modern knowledge
and conditions, are of doubtful general truth and limited
application. True, when confined and carefully applied to
citizens of the same blood and nationality; questionable,
when applied to human beings of different race in one nationality;
manifestly false, in the case of races less developed, and
in other, especially tropical, countries.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As fundamental principles,
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>it is admitted, they were excellent for a young people
struggling into recognition and limiting its attention narrowly
to what only concerned itself; but have we not manifestly
outgrown them, now that we ourselves have developed into
a great World Power? For such there was and necessarily
always will be, as between the superior and the inferior races,
a manifest common sense foundation in caste, and in the rule
of might when it presents itself in the form of what we are
pleased to call Manifest Destiny. As to government being
conditioned on the consent of the governed, it is obviously
the bounden duty of the superior race to hold the inferior
race in peaceful tutelage, and protect it against itself; and,
furthermore, when it comes to deciding the momentous question
of what races are superior and what inferior, what dominant
and what subject, that is of necessity a question to be
settled between the superior race and its own conscience;
and one in regard to the correct settlement of which it indicates
a tendency at once unpatriotic and "pessimistic," to
assume that America could by any chance decide otherwise
than correctly. Upon that score we must put implicit
confidence in the sound instincts and Christian spirit of the
dominant, that is, the stronger race.</p>

<p>It is the same with that other fundamental principle with
which the name of Lexington is, from the historical point of
view, so closely associated,&mdash;I refer, of course, to the revolutionary
contention that representation is a necessary adjunct
to taxation. This principle also, it is frankly argued, we
have outgrown, in presence of our new responsibilities; and,
as between the superior and inferior races, it is subject to
obvious limitations. Here again, as between the policy of
the "Open Door" and the Closed-Colonial-Market policy, the
superior race is amenable to its own conscience only. It will
doubtless on all suitable and convenient occasions bear in
mind that it is a "Trustee for Civilization."</p>

<p>Finally, as respects entangling foreign alliances, and their
necessary consequents, costly and burdensome armaments
and large standing armies, we are again advised that, having
ceased to be children, we should put away childish things.
Having become a great World Power we must become a
corresponding War Power. We are assured by high authority
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>that, were Washington now alive, it cannot be questioned
he would in all these respects modify materially the views
expressed in the Farewell Address, as being obviously inapplicable
to existing conditions. Under these circumstances,
and in view of the obligations we have assumed, the President,
and Secretaries of War and the Navy, recommend an
establishment the annual cost of which ($200,000,000), exclusive
of military pensions, is in excess of the largest of those
European War Budgets, over the crushing influence of which
we have expressed a traditional wonder, not unmixed with
pity for the unfortunate tax-payer.</p>

<p>Historically speaking, I believe these are all facts, susceptible
of verification. I do not mean to say that the
arguments developing obvious limitations in the application
of the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution have
been avowedly accepted by our representatives, or officially
incorporated into our domestic and foreign policy. I do
assert as an historical fact that these arguments have been
advanced, and are meeting, both in Congress and with the
press, a large degree of acceptance. And hence comes a
singular and most significant conclusion from which, historically,
there seems to be no escape. It may or it may not be
fortunate and right; it may or it may not lead to beneficent
future results; it may or it may not contribute to the good
of mankind. Those questions belong elsewhere than in the
rooms of an historical society. Upon them we are not called
to pass,&mdash;they belong to the politician, the publicist, the
philosopher, not to us. But, as historical investigators, and so
observing the sequence of events, it cannot escape our notice
that on every one of the fundamental principles discussed,&mdash;whether
ethnic, economical, or political,&mdash;we abandon the
traditional and distinctively American grounds and accept
those of Europe, and especially of Great Britain, which heretofore
we have made it the basis of our faith to deny and
repudiate.</p>

<p>With this startling proposition in mind, consider again the
several propositions advanced; and first, as regards the so-called
inferior races. Our policy towards them, instinctive
and formulated, has been either to exclude or destroy, or to
leave them in the fullness of time to work out their own
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>destiny, undisturbed by us; fully believing that, in this way,
we in the long run best subserved the interests of mankind.
Europe, and Great Britain especially, adopted the opposite
policy. They held that it was incumbent on the superior to
go forth and establish dominion over the inferior race, and to
hold and develop vast imperial possessions and colonial dependencies.
They saw their interest and duty in developing
systems of docile tutelage; we sought our inspirations in the
rough school of self-government. Under this head the result
then is distinct, clean cut, indisputable. To this conclusion
have we come at last. The Old World, Europe and Great
Britain, were, after all, right, and we of the New World have
been wrong. From every point of view,&mdash;religious, ethnic,
commercial, political,&mdash;we cannot, it is now claimed, too soon
abandon our traditional position and assume theirs. Again,
Europe and Great Britain have never admitted that men were
created equal, or that the consent of the governed was a condition
of government. They have, on the contrary, emphatically
denied both propositions. We now concede that, after
all, there was great basis for their denial; that, certainly, it
must be admitted, our forefathers were hasty at least in reaching
their conclusions,&mdash;they generalized too broadly. We
do not frankly avow error, and we still think the assent
of the governed to a government a thing desirable to be
secured, under suitable circumstances and with proper limitations;
but, if it cannot conveniently be secured, we are
advised on New England senatorial authority that "the
consent of some of the governed" will be sufficient, we
ourselves selecting those proper to be consulted. Thus
in such cases as certain islands of the Antilles, Hawaii, and
the communities of Asia, we admit that, so far as the principles
at the basis of the Declaration are concerned, Great
Britain was right, and our ancestors were, not perhaps wrong,
but too general, and of the eighteenth century, in their statements.
To that extent, we have outgrown the Declaration
of 1776, and have become as wise now as Great Britain was
then. At any rate we are not above learning. As was long
ago said,&mdash;"Only dead men and idiots never change;" and
the people of the United States are nothing unless open-minded.</p>

<p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>So, also, as respects the famous Boston "tea-party," and
taxation without representation. Great Britain then affirmed
this right in the case of colonies and dependencies. Taught
by the lesson of our War of Independence, she has since
abandoned it. We now take it up, and are to-day, as one of
the new obligations towards the heathen imposed upon us by
Providence, formulating systems of imposts and tariffs for our
new dependencies, wholly distinct from our own, and directly
inhibited by our constitution, in regard to which systems
those dependencies have no representative voice. They are
not to be consulted as to the kind of door, "open" or
"closed," behind which they are to exist. In taking this
position it is difficult to see why we must not also incidentally
admit that, in the great contention preceding our War
of Independence, the first armed clash of which resounded
here in Lexington, Great Britain was more nearly right than
the exponents of the principles for which those "embattled
farmers" contended.</p>

<p>Again, consider the Monroe Doctrine, entangling foreign
alliances, and the consequent and costly military and naval
establishments. The Monroe Doctrine had two sides, the
abstention of the Old World from interference in American
affairs, based on our abstention from interference in the
affairs of the Old World. But it is now argued we have outgrown
the Monroe Doctrine, or at least the latter branch of
it. It is certainly so considered in Europe; for, only a few
days ago, so eminent an authority as Lord Farrar exultingly
exclaimed in addressing the Cobden Club,&mdash;"America has
burned the swaddling clothes of the Monroe Doctrine." Indeed
we have, in discussion at least, gone far in advance of
the mere burning of cast-off infantile clothing, and alliances
with Great Britain and Japan, as against France and Russia,
are freely mooted, with a view to the forcible partition of
China, to which we are to be a party, and of it a beneficiary.
For it is already avowed that the Philippines are but a
"stopping-place" on the way to the continent of Asia; and
China, unlike Poland, is inhabited by an "inferior race," in
regard to whom, as large possible consumers of surplus products,
Providence has imposed on us obvious obligations,
material as well as benevolent and religious, which it would
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>be unlike ourselves to disregard. It is the mandate of duty,
we are told,&mdash;the nations of Europe obey it, and can we do
less than they? "Isolation" it is then argued is but another
name for an attention to one's own business which may well
become excessive, and result in selfishness. It is true that
the nations of the Old World have not heretofore erred conspicuously
in this respect; and as the "Balance of Power"
was the word-juggle with which to conjure up wars and
armaments in the eighteenth century, so the "Division of
Trade" may not impossibly prove the similar conjuring word-juggle
of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, "isolation"
is not compatible with the policy of a Great Nation under a
call to assert itself as a World Power. Then follows the
familiar argument in favor of costly military and naval establishments.
But, upon this head it is needless to restate our
traditional policy,&mdash;our jealousy as a people of militarism
and large standing armies, to be used, if occasion calls, as a
reserve police. Our record thereon is so plain that repetition
grows tedious. The record of Europe, and especially of Great
Britain as distinguished from other European powers, has been
equally plain, and is no less indisputable. In this respect,
also, always under compulsion, we now admit our error.
Costly armies are necessary to the maintenance of order,
Heaven's first law; and World Powers cannot maintain peace,
and themselves, without powerful navies and frequent coaling
stations.</p>

<p>Finally, even on such matters as the Protective System and
the encouragement of American Labor, as against the
"Pauper Labor" of Europe and of the inferior races, Great
Britain has for half a century now advocated the principle of
unrestricted industry and free trade,&mdash;that is the "Open
Door" policy logically carried to its final results. We have
denied it, establishing what we in time grew to call the distinctive
American system. It is, however, now asserted that
"Trade follows the Flag," and that, as respects dependencies
at least, the "Open Door" policy is the best policy. If
"Trade follows the Flag" in dependencies, and, by so doing,
affords the American producer all needful protection
and every fair advantage in those dependencies, it is not at
once apparent why it fails so to do at home. Is it less docile
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>to the flag, less in harmony with and subservient to it, in the
United States, within our own limits, than in remote lands
under that flag beyond the seas? And, if so, how is such an
apparent anomaly accounted for? But with this question we
are not concerned. That problem is for the economist to
solve, for in character it is commercial, not historical. The
point with us is that again, as regards the "Open Door,"&mdash;free
trade and no favor, so far as all outside competition
is concerned, American labor and "pauper" labor being
equally outside,&mdash;on this long and hotly contested point, also,
England appears on the face of things to have had after all
much the best of the argument.</p>

<p>As regards "Pauper Labor," indeed, the reversal contemplated
of established policy in favor of European methods is
specially noteworthy. The labor of Asia is undeniably less well
paid even than that of Europe; but it is now proposed, by a
single act, to introduce into our industrial system ten millions
of Asiatics, either directly, or through their products sold in
open competition with our own; or, if we do not do that, to
hold them, ascribed to the soil in a sort of old Saxon serfdom,
with the function assigned them of consuming our surplus
products, but without in return sending us theirs. The
great counterbalancing consideration will not, of course, be
forgotten that, like the English in India, we also bestow on
them the Blessings of Liberty and the Bible; provided, always,
that liberty does not include freedom to go to the United
States, and the Bible does include the excellent Old Time and
Old World precept (Coloss. 3: 22), "Servants, obey in all
things your masters."</p>

<p>It is the same in other respects. It seems to be admitted
by the President, and by the leading authorities on the imperialistic
policy, that it can only be carried to successful
results through the agency of a distinct governing class.
Accordingly administration through the agency of military
or naval officers is strongly urged both by the President and
by Captain Mahan. Other advocates of the policy urge its
adoption on the ground, very distinctly avowed, that it will
necessitate an established, recognized Civil Service, modelled,
they add, on that of Great Britain. If, they then argue,
Great Britain can extend&mdash;as, indeed, she unquestionably
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>has extended&mdash;her system of dependencies all over the
globe, developing them into the most magnificent empire the
world ever saw, it is absurd, unpatriotic, and pessimistic to
doubt that we can do the same. Are we not of the same
blood, and the same speech? This is all historically true.
Historically it is equally true that, to do it, we must employ
means similar to those Great Britain has employed. In
other words, modelling ourselves on Great Britain, we must
slowly and methodically develop and build up a recognized
and permanent governing and official class. The heathen
and barbarian need to be studied, and dealt with intelligently
and on a system; they cannot be successfully managed on
any principle of rotation in office, much less one which ascribes
the spoils of office to the victors at the polls. What
these advocates of Imperialism say is unquestionably true:
The political methods now in vogue in American cities are
not adapted to the government of dependencies.</p>

<p>The very word "Imperial" is, indeed, borrowed from the
Old World. As applied to a great system of colonial dominion
and foreign dependencies it is English, and very modern English,
also, for it was first brought into vogue by the late Earl
of Beaconsfield in 1879, when, by Act of Parliament introduced
by him, the Queen of England was made Empress of India.
It was then he enunciated that doctrine of <i>imperium et libertas</i>,
the adoption of which we are now considering. While it
may be wise and sound, it indisputably is British.</p>

<p>Thus, curiously enough, whichever way we turn and
however we regard it, at the close of more than a century of
independent existence we find ourselves, historically speaking,
involved in a mesh of contradictions with our past. Under a
sense of obligation, impelled by circumstances, perhaps to
a degree influenced by ambition and commercial greed, we
have one by one abandoned our distinctive national tenets,
and accepted in their place, though in some modified forms,
the old-time European tenets and policies, which we supposed
the world, actuated largely by our example, was about forever
to discard. Our whole record as a people is, of course, then
ransacked and subjected to microscopic investigation, and
every petty disregard of principle, any wrong heretofore
silently, perhaps sadly, ignored, each unobserved or disregarded
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>innovation of the past, is magnified into a precedent
justifying anything and everything in the future. If we
formerly on some occasion swallowed a gnat, why now, is it
asked, strain at a camel? Truths once accepted as "self-evident,"
since become awkward of acceptance, were ever
thus pettifogged out of the path, and fundamental principles
have in this way prescriptively been tampered with. It is
now nearly a century and a quarter ago, when Great Britain
was contemplating the subjection of her American dependencies,
that Edmund Burke denounced "tampering" with the
"ingenuous and noble roughness of truly constitutional
materials," as "the odious vice of restless and unstable
minds." Historically speaking it is not unfair to ask if this
is less so in the United States in 1898 than it was in Great
Britain in 1775.</p>

<p>What is now proposed, therefore, examined in connection
with our principles and traditional policy as a nation, does
apparently indicate a break in continuity,&mdash;historically, it will
probably constitute what is known in geology as a "fault."
Indeed, it is almost safe to say that history hardly records
any change of base and system on the part of a great people
at once so sudden, so radical, and so pregnant with consequences.
To the optimist,&mdash;he who has no dislike to "Old
Jewry," as the proper receptacle for worn-out garments, personal
or political,&mdash;the outlook is inspiring. He insensibly
recalls and repeats those fine lines of Tennyson:</p>

<p>To others, older perhaps, but at any rate more deeply impressed
with the difference apt to develop between dreams
and actualities, the situation calls to mind a comparison,
more historical it is true, but less inspiriting so far as a commitment
to the new policy is concerned. At the risk, possibly,
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>of offending some of those present, I will venture to
institute it. In the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to
St. Matthew, I find this incident recorded: "The devil
taketh him [the Saviour] up into an exceeding high mountain,
and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the
glory of them; and saith unto him, All these things will I
give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith
Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan. Then the devil leaveth
him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."
Now, historically speaking, and as a matter of scriptural exegesis,
that this passage should be accepted literally is not
supposable. Satan, on the occasion referred to, must not be
taken to have presented himself to the Saviour <i>in propri&acirc;
person&acirc;</i> with his attributes of horns, tail, and cloven hoof, and
made an outright proposition of extra-territorial sovereignty.
It was a parable. He who had assumed a lofty moral attitude
was tempted by worldly inducements to adopt a lower attitude,&mdash;that,
in a word, common among men. It was a whispering
to Christ of what among nations, is known as "Manifest
Destiny;" in that case, however, as possibly in others, it so
chanced that the whispering was not from the Almighty, but
from Satan. Now if, instead of recognizing the source whence
the temptation came, and sternly saying, "Get thee hence,
Satan," Christ had seen the proposition as a new Mission,&mdash;thought,
in fact, that he heard a distinct call to Duty,&mdash;and
so, accepting a Responsibility thrust upon him, had hurried
down from the "exceeding high mountain," and proceeded at
once to lay in a supply of weapons and to don defensive armor,
renouncing his peaceful mission, he would have done exactly&mdash;what
Mohammed did six centuries later!</p>

<p>I do not for a moment mean to suggest that, as respects the
voice of "Manifest Destiny," there is any similarity between
the case of the Saviour and that which we, as a people, are
now considering. I am not a prophet, nor do I claim prophetic
insight. We are merely historical investigators, and,
as such, not admitted into the councils of the Almighty.
Others doubtless are, or certainly claim to be. They know
every time, and at once, whether it is the inspiration of God
or the devil; and forthwith proclaim it from the house-tops.
We must admit&mdash;at any rate no evidence in our possession
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>enables us to deny&mdash;the confidential relations such claim to
have with either or both of the agencies in question,&mdash;the
Divine or the Infernal. All I now have in mind is to call
attention to the obvious similarity of the positions. As compared
with the ideals and tenets then in vogue,&mdash;principles
of manhood, equality before the law, freedom, peace on earth,
and good-will to men,&mdash;the United States, heretofore and seen
in a large way, has, among nations, assumed a peculiar, and,
from the moral point of view, unquestionably a lofty attitude.
Speaking historically it might, and with no charge of levity,
be compared with a similar moral attitude assumed among
men eighteen centuries before by the Saviour. It discountenanced
armaments and warfare; it advocated arbitrations,
and bowed to their awards; spreading its arms and protection
over the New World, it refused to embroil itself in the
complications of the Old; above all, it set a not unprofitable
example to the nations of benefits incident to minding
one's own business, and did not arrogate to itself
the character of a favorite and inspired instrument in the
hands of God. It even went so far as to assume that, in
working out the inscrutable ways of Providence, character,
self-restraint, and moral grandeur were in the long run as
potent in effecting results as iron-clads and gatling-guns.</p>

<p>Those who now advocate a continuance of this policy are,
as neatly as wittily, referred to in discussion, "for want of a
better name," as "Little Americans," just as in history the
believers in the long-run efficacy of the doctrines of Christ
might be termed "Little Gospellers," to distinguish them
from the admirers of the later, but more brilliant and imperial,
dispensation of Mohammed. That the earlier, and less immediately
ambitious, doctrine was, in the case of the United
States, only temporary, and is now outgrown, and must,
therefore, be abandoned in favor of Old World methods, especially
those pursued with such striking success by Great
Britain, is possible. As historical investigators we have long
since learned that it is the unexpected which in the development
of human affairs is most apt to occur. Who, for
instance, in our own recent history could ever have foreseen
that, in the inscrutable ways of the Almighty, the great triumph
of Slavery in the annexation of Texas, and the spoliation
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>of that inferior race which inhabited Mexico, was, within
fifteen years only, to result in what Lincoln called that
"terrible war" in which every drop of blood ever drawn
by the lash was paid by another drawn by the sword?
Again, in May, 1856, a Representative of South Carolina
struck down a Senator from Massachusetts in the Senate-chamber
at Washington; in January, 1865, Massachusetts
battalions bivouacked beside the smoking ruins of South
Carolina's capital. Verily, as none know better than we, the
ways of Providence are mysterious, and past finding out.
None the less, though it cannot be positively asserted that
the world would not have been wiser, more advanced, and
better ordered had Christ, when on that "exceeding high
mountain," heard in the words then whispered in his ear a
manifest call of Duty, and felt a Responsibility thrust upon
him to secure the kingdoms of the earth for the Blessings of
Liberty and the Bible by so small a sacrifice as making an apparently
meaningless obeisance to Satan, yet we can certainly
say that the world would now have been very different
from what it is had He so done. And so in the case of the
United States, though we cannot for a moment assert that
its fate and the future of the world will not be richer, better,
and brighter from its abandonment of New World traditions
and policies in favor of the traditions and policies of the Old
World, we can say without any hesitation that the course of
history will be greatly changed by the so doing.</p>

<p>In any event the experiment will be one of surpassing
interest to the historical observer. Some years ago James
Russell Lowell was asked by the French historian, Guizot,
how long the Republic of the United States might reasonably
be expected to endure. Mr. Lowell's reply has always been
considered peculiarly happy. "So long," said he, "as the
ideas of its founders continue dominant." In due course of
time we, or those who follow us, will know whether Mr.
Lowell diagnosed the situation correctly, or otherwise. Meanwhile,
I do not know how I can better bring to an end this
somewhat lengthy contribution to the occasion, than by repeating,
as singularly applicable to the conditions in which
we find ourselves, these verses from a recent poem, than
which I have heard none in the days that now are which
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>strike a deeper or a truer chord, or one more appropriate to
this New England Paschal eve:</p>

<p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>Taken in connection with the foregoing paper, the following-letter,
addressed to the Hon. Carl Schurz, is self-explanatory:</p>

<p class="right"><br />
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, December 21, 1898.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Schurz</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>In a recent letter you kindly suggest that I submit to you
a sketch of what, I think, should be said in an address such
as it is proposed should now be put forth by the Anti-Imperialist
League to the people of the United States.</p>

<p>I last evening read a paper before the Lexington Historical
Society, in which I discussed the question of extra-territorial
expansion from the historical point of view. A copy
of this paper I hope soon to forward you. Meanwhile, there
is one aspect, and, to my mind, the all-important aspect of the
question, which, in addressing an historical society, was not
germane. I refer to the question of a practical policy to be
pursued by us, as a nation, under existing conditions. That
Spain has abandoned all claim of sovereignty over the Philippine
islands admits of no question. Whether the United
States has accepted the sovereignty thus abandoned is still
an open question; but this I do not regard as material.
Nevertheless, we are confronted by a fact; and, whenever we
criticise the policy up to this time pursued; we are met with
an inquiry as to what we have to propose in place of it. We
are invited to stop finding fault with others, and to suggest
some feasible alternative policy ourselves.</p>

<p>To this we must, therefore, in fairness, address ourselves.
It is, in my judgment, useless to attempt to carry on the discussion
merely in the negative form. As opponents of an
inchoate policy we must, in place of what we object to, propose
something positive, or we must abandon the field. Accepting
the alternative, I now want to suggest a positive
policy for the consideration of those who feel as we feel. I
wish your judgment upon it.</p>

<p>There has, it seems to me, been a great deal of idle
"Duty," "Mission," and "Call" talk on the subject of our
recent acquisition of "Islands beyond the Sea," and the necessity
of adopting some policy, commonly described as "Imperial,"
in dealing with them. This policy is, in the minds
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>of most people who favor it, to be indirectly modelled on the
policy heretofore so successfully pursued under somewhat
similar conditions by Great Britain. It involves, as I tried
to point out in the Lexington paper I have referred to, the
abandonment or reversal of all the fundamental principles of
our government since its origin, and of the foreign policy we
have heretofore pursued. This, I submit, is absolutely unnecessary.
Another and substitute policy, purely American,
as contradistinguished from the European or British, known
as "Imperial," policy, can readily be formulated.</p>

<p>This essentially American policy would be based both
upon our cardinal political principles, and our recent foreign
experiences. It is commonly argued that, having destroyed
the existing government in Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines,
we have assumed a political responsibility, and are
under a moral obligation to provide another government in
place of that which by our action has ceased to exist. What
has been our course heretofore under similar circumstances?
Precedents, I submit, at once suggest themselves. Precedents,
too, directly in point, and within your and my easy
recollection.</p>

<p>I refer to the course pursued by us towards Mexico in the
year 1848, and again in 1866; towards Hayti for seventy
years back; and towards Venezuela as recently as three
years ago. It is said that the inhabitants of the islands of
the Antilles, and much more those of the Philippine archipelago,
are as yet unfitted to maintain a government; and
that they should be kept in a condition of "tutelage" until
they are fitted so to do. It is further argued that a stable
government is necessary, and that it is out of the question
for us to permit a condition of chronic disturbance and scandalous
unrest to exist so near our own borders as Cuba and
Porto Rico. Yet how long, I would ask, did that condition
exist in Mexico? And with what results? How long has
it existed in Hayti? Has the government of Venezuela ever
been "stable"? Have we found it necessary or thought it
best to establish a governmental protectorate in any of those
immediately adjacent regions?</p>

<p>What has been, historically, our policy&mdash;the American,
as distinguished from the European and British policy&mdash;towards
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>those communities,&mdash;two of them Spanish, one African?
So far as foreign powers are concerned, we have laid
down the principle of "Hands-off." So far as their own
government was concerned, we insisted that the only way to
learn to walk was to try to walk, and that the history of mankind
did not show that nations placed under systems of "tutelage,"&mdash;taught
to lean for support on a superior power,&mdash;ever
acquired the faculty of independent action.</p>

<p>Of this, with us, fundamental truth, the British race itself
furnishes a very notable example. In the forty-fourth year of
the Christian era the island of Great Britain was occupied by
what the "Imperial" Romans adjudged to be an inferior
race. To the Romans the Britons unquestionably were inferior.
Every child's history contains an account of the
course then pursued by the superior towards that inferior
race, and its results. The Romans occupied Great Britain,
and they occupied it hard upon four centuries, holding the
people in "tutelage," and protecting them against themselves,
as well as against their enemies. With what result?
So emasculated and incapable of self-government did the
people of England become during their "tutelage" that,
when Rome at last withdrew, they found themselves totally
unfitted for self-government, much more for facing a foreign
enemy. As the last, and best, historian of the English
people tells us, the purely despotic system of the imperial
government "by crushing all local independence, crushed all
local vigor. Men forgot how to fight for their country when
they forgot how to govern it."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The end was that, through
six centuries more, England was overrun, first by those of
one race, and then by those of another, until the Normans
established themselves in it as conquerors; and then, and not
until then, the deteriorating effect of a system of long continued
"tutelage" ceased to be felt, and the islanders became
by degrees the most energetic, virile, and self-sustaining of
races. As nearly, therefore, as can be historically stated, it
took eight centuries for the people of England to overcome
the injurious influence of four centuries of just such a system
as it is now proposed by us to inflict on the Philippines.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>Hindostan would furnish another highly suggestive example
of the educational effects of "tutelage" on a race. After a
century and a half of that British "tutelage," what progress
has India made towards fitness for self-government? Is
the end in sight?</p>

<p>From the historical point of view, it is instructive to note
the exactly different results reached through the truly American
policy we have pursued in the not dissimilar cases of
Hayti and Mexico. While Hayti, it is true, has failed to
make great progress in one century, it has made quite as
much progress as England made during any equal period
immediately after Rome withdrew from it. And that degree
of slowness in growth, which with equanimity has been endured
by us in Hayti, could certainly be endured by us in
islands on the coast of Asia. It cannot be gainsaid that,
through our insisting on the policy of non-interference ourselves,
and of non-interference by European nations, Hayti
has been brought into a position where it is on the high road
to better things in future. That has been the result of the
prescriptive American policy. With Mexico, the case is far
stronger. We all know that in 1848, after our war of spoliation,
we had to bolster up a semblance of a government for
Mexico, with which to negotiate a treaty of peace. Mexico
at that time was reduced by us to a condition of utter anarchy.
Under the theory now gaining in vogue, it would then
have been our plain duty to make of Mexico an extra-territorial
dependency, and protect it against itself. We wisely
took a different course. Like other Spanish communities in
America, Mexico than passed through a succession of revolutions,
from which it became apparent the people were not
in a fit condition for self-government. Nevertheless, sternly
insisting on non-interference by outside powers, we ourselves
wisely left that country to work out its own salvation in its
own way.</p>

<p>In 1862, when the United States was involved in the War
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>of the Rebellion, the Europeans took advantage of the situation
to invade Mexico, and to establish there a "stable government."
They undertook to protect that people against
themselves, and to erect for them a species of protectorate,
such as we now propose for the Philippines. As soon as our
war was over, we insisted upon the withdrawal of Europe
from Mexico. What followed is matter of recent history.
It is unnecessary to recall it. We did not reduce Mexico into
a condition of "tutelage," or establish over it a "protectorate"
of our own. We, on the contrary, insisted that it
should stand on its own legs; and, by so doing, learn to stand
firmly on them, just as a child learns to walk, by being compelled
to try to walk, not by being kept everlastingly in
"leading strings." This was the American, as contradistinguished
from the European policy; and Mexico to-day walks
firmly.</p>

<p>Finally take the case of Venezuela in 1895. I believe I
am not mistaken when I say that, during the twenty-five
preceding years, Venezuela had undergone almost as many
revolutions. It certainly had not enjoyed a stable government.
Through disputes over questions of boundary, Great
Britain proposed to confer that indisputable blessing upon a
considerable region. We interfered under a most questionable
extension of the Monroe Doctrine, and asserted the
principle of "Hands-off." Having done this,&mdash;having in
so far perpetuated what we now call the scandal of anarchy,&mdash;we
did not establish "tutelage," or a protectorate, ourselves.
We wisely left Venezuela to work out its destiny in
its own way, and in the fullness of time. That policy was
far-seeing, beneficent, and strictly American in 1895. Why,
then, make almost indecent haste to abandon it in 1898?</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of finding our precedents in the experience
of England, or that of any other European power, I would
suggest that the true course for this country now to pursue
is exactly the course we have heretofore pursued under similar
conditions. Let us be true to our own traditions, and
follow our own precedents. Having relieved the Spanish
islands from the dominion of Spain, we should declare concerning
them a policy of "Hands-off," both on our own part
and on the part of other powers. We should say that the
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>independence of those islands is morally guaranteed by us
as a consequence of the treaty of Paris, and then leave them
just as we have left Hayti, and just as we left Mexico and
Venezuela, to adopt for themselves such form of government
as the people thereof are ripe for. In the cases of Mexico
and Venezuela, and in the case of Hayti, we have not found
it necessary to interfere ever or at all. It is not yet apparent
why we should find it necessary to interfere with islands so
much more remote from us than Hayti, and than Mexico
and Venezuela, as are the Philippines.</p>

<p>In this matter we can thus well afford to be consistent, as
well as logical. Our fundamental principles, those of the
Declaration, the Constitution, and the Monroe Doctrine, have
not yet been shown to be unsound&mdash;why should we be in such
a hurry to abandon them? Our precedents are close at hand,
and satisfactory&mdash;why look away from them to follow those
of Great Britain? Why need we, all of a sudden, be so very
English and so altogether French, even borrowing their
nomenclature of "imperialism?" Why can not we, too, in
the language of Burke, be content to set our feet "in the
tracks of our forefathers, where we can neither wander nor
stumble?" The only difficulty in the way of our so doing
seems to be that we are in such a desperate hurry; while
natural influences and methods, though in the great end
indisputably the wisest and best, always require time in
which to work themselves out to their results. Wiser than
the Almighty in our own conceit, we think to get there at
once; the "there" in this case being everlasting "tutelage,"
as in India, instead of ultimate self-government, as in
Mexico.</p>

<p>The policy heretofore pursued by us in such cases,&mdash;the
policy of "Hands-off," and "Walk alone," is distinctly
American; it is not European, not even British. It recognizes
the principles of our Declaration of Independence.
It recognizes the truth that all just government exists by the
consent of the governed. It recognizes the existence of
the Monroe Doctrine. In a word, it recognizes every principle
and precedent, whether natural or historical, which has
from the beginning lain at the foundation of our American
polity. It does not attempt the hypocritical contradiction in
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>terms, of pretending to elevate a people into a self-sustaining
condition through the leading-string process of "tutelage."
It appeals to our historical experience, applying to present
conditions the lessons of Hayti, Mexico, and Venezuela.
In dealing with those cases, we did not find a great standing
army or an enormous navy necessary; and, if not then, why
now? Why such a difference between the Philippines and
Hayti? Is Cuba larger or nearer to us than Mexico? When,
therefore, in future they ask us what course and policy we
Anti-Imperialists propose, our answer should be that we propose
to pursue towards the islands of Antilles and the Philippines
the same common-sense course and truly American
policy which were by us heretofore pursued with such signal
success in the cases of Hayti, Mexico, and Venezuela, all inhabited
by people equally unfit for self-government, and
geographically much closer to ourselves. We propose to
guarantee them against outside meddling, and, above all,
from "tutelage," and make them, by walking, learn to walk
alone.</p>

<p>This, I submit, is not only an answer to the question so
frequently put to us, but a positive policy following established
precedents, and, what is more, purely American, as
distinguished from a European or British, policy and precedents.</p>

in beauty of form or health of body. Diversity or inequality in these respects is the
law of creation. But this inequality is in no particular inconsistent with complete
civil or political equality.
</p><p>
"The equality declared by our fathers in 1776 and made the fundamental law of
Massachusetts in 1780, was <i>Equality before the Law</i>. Its object was to efface all political
or civil distinctions, and to abolish all institutions founded upon <i>birth</i>. 'All
men are <i>created</i> equal,' says the Declaration of Independence. 'All men are <i>born</i>
free and equal,' says the Massachusetts Bill of Rights. These are not vain words.
Within the sphere of their influence, no person can be <i>created</i>, no person can be <i>born</i>,
with civil or political privileges not enjoyed equally by all his fellow-citizens; nor
can any institutions be established, recognizing distinctions of birth. Here is the
Great Charter of every human being drawing vital breath upon this soil, whatever
may be his conditions, and whoever may be his parents. He may be poor, weak,
humble, or black,&mdash;he may be of Caucasian, Jewish, Indian, or Ethiopian race,&mdash;he
may be born of French, German, English, or Irish extraction; but before the
Constitution of Massachusetts all these distinctions disappear. He is not poor,
weak, humble, or black; nor is he Caucasian, Jew, Indian, or Ethiopian; nor is he
French, German, English, or Irish; he is a MAN, the equal of all his fellow-men.
He is one of the children of the State, which, like an impartial parent, regards all its
offspring with an equal care. To some it may justly allot higher duties, according
to higher capacities; but it welcomes all to its equal hospitable board. The State,
imitating the divine Justice, is no respecter of persons."&mdash;<i>Works of Charles Sumner,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Historically speaking, the assertion in the Declaration of Independence has
been fruitful of dispute. The very evening the present paper was read at Lexington
the Mayor of Boston, in a public address elsewhere, alluded to the "imprudent
generalizations of our forefathers," referring, doubtless, to what Rufus Choate,
forty-two years before, described as "the glittering and sounding generalities of
natural right" to be found in the Declaration, "that passionate and eloquent
manifesto." Mr. Calhoun declared (1848) that the claim of human equality set forth
in the Declaration was "the most false and dangerous of all political errors,"
which, after resting a long time "dormant," had, in the process of time, begun "to
germinate and produce its poisonous fruits." Mr. Pettit, a Senator from Indiana,
pronounced it in 1854, "a self-evident lie." In the famous Lincoln-Douglas debate
in Illinois (1860) the question reappeared, Mr. Douglas contending that the Declaration
applied only to "the white people of the United States;" while Mr. Lincoln,
in reply, asserted that "the entire records of the world, from the date of the
Declaration of Independence up to within three years ago, may be searched in vain
for one single affirmation, from one single man, that the negro was not included in
the Declaration." The contention of Mr. Douglas had recently again made its
appearance in the press as something too indisputable to admit of discussion. It is
asserted that, in penning the Declaration, Mr. Jefferson could not possibly have
intended to include those then actually held as slaves. On this point Mr. Jefferson
himself should, it would seem, be accepted as a competent witness. Referring to
the denial of his "inalienable rights" to the African, he declared at a later day, "I
tremble for my country, when I reflect that God is just." What he meant will,
however, probably continue matter for confident newspaper assertions just so long
as anybody in this country wants to make out, as did Stephen A. Douglas in 1860, a
plausible pretext for subjugating somebody else,&mdash;Indian, African, or Asiatic. As
Mr. Lincoln expressed it, "The assertion that all men are created equal was of no
practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain, and it was placed in
the Declaration, not for that but for future use. Its author meant it to be, as,
thank God, it is now proving itself, a stumbling block to all those who, in after
times, might seek to turn a free people back into the paths of despotism. They
knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant, when such

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
